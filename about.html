           <h1>About</h1>
           <h2>Iâ€™m Becky, and I live in Doncaster with my partner.<br><br>

After many years of baking for family and friends, in 2014 I decided to take the plunge and start taking on orders from the public. Since then Quackers Creations has grown to offer a wide variety of home baked cakes.<br><br>

I pride myself on the quality, creativity and delicious tast of my cakes.<br><br>


The cakes I bake for sale are to the same high standard as the ones I would make for friends and family. We have a wide range of stock cake options but I really shine when creating bespoke designs and flavours to fit your needs. I wont turn away any brief!<br><br>

Please enquire using the contact page on this website and I will get back to you.</h2>
